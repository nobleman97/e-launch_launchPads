- Vesting? [Yes or No] (Done)

- How many months? (Done)
- How many percent per month? (Done)
- Create pocket for each month (Use array? OR use mapping?)... Mapping wins (Done)

- Upon finalizing, calculate how much each person should have per pocket and assign values
    (or should this be done when user buys?... I think so.)
- Each pocket will be time locked... 30 days from the previous one
-- When claiming, you get to choose which pocket you want to claim from.
